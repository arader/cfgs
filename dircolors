# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
# string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
# Attribute codes:
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
#NORMAL 00	# no color code at all
#FILE 00	# regular file: use no color at all
RESET 0		# reset to "normal" color
DIR 34	# directory
LINK 35	# symbolic link.  (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
                # numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
MULTIHARDLINK 00	# regular file with more than one link
FIFO 36	# pipe
SOCK 36	# socket
DOOR 35	# door
BLK 31	# block device driver
CHR 31	# character device driver
ORPHAN 31 # symlink to nonexistent file, or non-stat'able file ...
MISSING 00      # ... and the files they point to
SETUID 31	# file that is setuid (u+s)
SETGID 01;31	# file that is setgid (g+s)
CAPABILITY 00	# file with capability
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 00;36 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 00;33 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
STICKY 01;36	# dir with the sticky bit set (+t) and not other-writable

# This is for files with execute permission:
EXEC 32

# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to colorize below. Put the extension, a space, and the color init string.
# (and any comments you want to add after a '#')

# If you use DOS-style suffixes, you may want to uncomment the following:
#.cmd 01;32 # executables (bright green)
#.exe 01;32
#.com 01;32
#.btm 01;32
#.bat 01;32
# Or if you want to colorize scripts even if they do not have the
# executable bit actually set.
#.sh  01;32
#.csh 01;32
